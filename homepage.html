        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <p>The Tiny Miracles Foundation started with picking up one child from the street to get her educated. However, soon they realized the 
parents did not understand why their child should go to school in the first place. Seeing this happen often and listening to their needs 
led to a realization that in order to break the cycle of poverty, a mindset shift needs to take place. People need hope and tools for a 
better future. Through trial and error, the nonprofit has designed a holistic approach that focuses on all areas of life, and not just 
educating children. There are five areas to break the cycle:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Health</li>
<li>Education</li>
<li>Social Awareness</li>
<li>Skills Training</li>
<li>Celebration</li>
</ul>
